{"definition": "scib_metrics.utils.pca(X,n_components=None,return_svd=False)", "description": "Method of data analysis Principal component analysis ( PCA ) is a linear dimensionality reduction technique with applications in exploratory data analysis , visualization and data preprocessing . The data is linearly transformed onto a new coordinate system such that the directions (principal components) capturing the largest variation in the data can be easily identified. The principal components of a collection of points in a real coordinate space are a sequence of unit vectors , where the -th vector is the direction of a line that best fits the data while being orthogonal to the first vectors. Here, a best-fitting line is defined as one that minimizes the average squared perpendicular distance from the points to the line . These directions (i.e., principal components) constitute an orthonormal basis in which different individual dimensions of the data are linearly uncorrelated ."}
