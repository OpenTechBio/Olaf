It is a main task of exploratory data analysis , and a common technique for statistical data analysis , used in many fields, including pattern recognition , image analysis , information retrieval , bioinformatics , data compression , computer graphics and machine learning . Cluster analysis refers to a family of algorithms and tasks rather than one specific algorithm . It can be achieved by various algorithms that differ significantly in their understanding of what constitutes a cluster and how to efficiently find them. Popular notions of clusters include groups with small distances between cluster members, dense areas of the data space, intervals or particular statistical distributions ."}

The most common type is known as sickle cell anemia . Sickle cell anemia results in an abnormality in the oxygen-carrying protein haemoglobin found in red blood cells . This leads to the red blood cells adopting an abnormal sickle -like shape under certain circumstances; with this shape, they are unable to deform as they pass through capillaries , causing blockages. Problems in sickle cell disease typically begin around 5 to 6 months of age."}

In natural language processing , importance is represented by \"soft\" weights assigned to each word in a sentence. More generally, attention encodes vectors called token embeddings across a fixed-width sequence that can range from tens to millions of tokens in size. Unlike \"hard\" weights, which are computed during the backwards training pass, \"soft\" weights exist only in the forward pass and therefore change with every step of the input. Earlier designs implemented the attention mechanism in a serial recurrent neural network (RNN) language translation system, but a more recent design, namely the transformer , removed the slower sequential RNN and relied more heavily on the faster parallel attention scheme."}
